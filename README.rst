**NOTE:** This experiment is not relevant anymore - we're using `gcloud-rest`_

Synchronous Google Cloud Client Library for Python
==================================================

This project is a collection of Google Cloud client libraries which have been built to work with
`Requests`_.

If you can use asyncio, have a look at `gcloud-aio`_ instead.
